## System Administration

System Administration is the process of managing, troubleshooting, and maintaining the solution. To complete this, system administrators are granted permissions over the solution. The allocation of permissions to administrators should align with the administrator's role within the organisation and the principle of least privileged access. The allocation of permission to the administrator's role is captured within the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) policy.

### Administrative Consoles

To manage and configure the solution, administrators will use various administrative consoles. These consoles are a mixture of server based and web-based consoles that exist internally or in the cloud.

Web based administrative consoles are provided by Microsoft however the urls for these consoles constantly change (refer to [Microsoft Security Portals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/mtp/portals?view=o365-worldwide)). The consoles listed below are correct at the time of writing.
